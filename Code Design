1. Keep track of the length of all jumps of the frog and make a way to access the variable.
  - Add a static variable to keep track of each total jumps
  - Increment the total jumps based on the amount of jumps in the simulate() method
  - Create a method which returns the total jumps

2. Record the highest jump.
  - Add a private variable to keep track of the highest jump.
  - Add code within the simulate() method to check if the frog has the highest jump

3. Record the lowest jump.
  - Add a private variable to keep track of the lowest jump.
  - Add code within the simulate() method to check if the frog has the lowest jump

4. Create a way to update goalDistance variable.
  - Create a mutator method which changes the goalDistance based on user input

5. Create a way to update maxHops variable.
  - Create a mutator method which changes the maxHops based on user input

6. Create a tester class for FrogSimulation.
  - Allow the user to create a FrogSimulation object for simulation
  - Allow the user to modify the FrogSimulation object based on existing code
  - Display the private variables for the FrogSimulation object.
